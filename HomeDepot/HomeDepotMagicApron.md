Gather tools: You may need basic tools like a screwdriver and a wrench.

Remove the door hinges: The hinges will be located on the opposite side of the door swing you want to change. Remove the screws or bolts holding the hinges in place.
Reverse the hinges: Depending on the model, you may need to flip the hinges or use different mounting holes to install them on the opposite side.
 6. **Reattach the doors:** Carefully lift and reattach the doors to the hinges on the new side.
    7. **Reattach the handles:** Secure the handles on the new side using the screws or bolts you removed earlier.

I'm trying to understand all the steps to creating a 12x12 patio. Dig out ground, tamp, Weed cloth, leveling sand, (brock panel or base sand? ), pavers, paver edging, EZ Sand, tamp?": [], 'Can this be used as a way to keep landscape rock/gravel from washing away?': [], 'Do you wet it that it hardens': ["Yes, you do need to wet the polymeric sand for it to harden. The water activates the binding agents in the sand, causing it to solidify. Be sure to follow the manufacturer's instructions for the specific product you are using."], 'I haven’t bought this product yet, I just put 71 bricks of paver on the ground and it supposed to start raining tonight,is it ok to on the filler when it’s wet or moisture ?': ["It's best to apply polymeric sand when the pavers and the surrounding area are completely dry. Moisture can interfere with the activation and proper hardening of the sand. It's recommended to wait until after the rain has passed and everything has dried thoroughly before applying the product."], 'Can this be put directly into the ground to help with erosion.': ["This product is designed for filling joints between pavers, not for direct application to the ground to prevent erosion. It's best used in applications like patios, walkways, and driveways where it helps stabilize and lock pavers in place. For erosion control, I recommend exploring other landscaping solutions specifically designed for that purpose."], 'can this product be used to fill cracks in asphalt': ['I did that last year on a crack caused by tree roots approx 3 ft x 1/2 inch. Up to an inch in depth. It hardened and is holding up well 8 months later. I intend to seal over it.'], 'Can this be used as a filler in older already grouted pavers?': ['This product is designed for joints between 1/8" and 1/2" wide. If your existing grout lines fall within this range and you've removed the old grout, then yes, you can use this product. However, if the joints are already filled with grout, this product is not suitable as a filler on top of existing grout.'], 'How many needed for 60 square feet': ['The side states 55sq fret'], 'Can I use this product to fill cracks in garage Floors and concrete driveway? Cracks are a 1/8” to less than 3/8”.': [], 'So only use in between my hand chiseled granite cobblestone right?': ['This product is designed for regular interlocking paver joints that are 1/8" to 1/2" wide. Whether it's appropriate for your hand-chiseled granite cobblestone depends on the specific dimensions of the gaps between the stones. If the gaps fall within that range, then it can be used. However, if the gaps are significantly larger or smaller, it might not be the ideal choice. You may want to consult with a professional for recommendations specific to your project.'], 'How do you keep the sand in place while it sets on an elevated edge? I have brick steps and would like to be able to finish the edge.': ["Unfortunately, polymeric sand isn't designed for elevated edges. It requires containment on all sides to stay in place while setting. Since your brick steps have an exposed edge, the sand would likely wash away or crumble before it hardens. You might consider using a different product like mortar or concrete for the edges of your steps."], 'Should you seal the pavers before using ez sand?': ['After'], 'Can this be used with bluestone?': ['Yes, this product can be used with bluestone.'], 'Product hardened well at first, but after 1st rain, the top layer softened and flacked off. Is this normal and single occurrence?': ["This is not normal and indicates an issue with the application. Several factors could have contributed to this:

 

Insufficient Watering: The polymeric sand needs enough water to activate the binding agents. Inadequate watering can result in a weak surface layer that washes away. Make sure to follow the manufacturer's instructions for watering. It usually requires two watering cycles.
Excessive Watering: While crucial for activation, too much water can also disrupt the setting process. Avoid heavy streams of water and ensure proper drainage to prevent pooling.
Rain before full cure: If rain occurred before the sand had a chance to fully cure, the surface could be compromised. Check the recommended curing time and try to protect the area from rain during this period.
Contamination: Dust, dirt, or other debris on the pavers before application can interfere with the sand's adhesion. Ensure the pavers are clean before applying the sand.

 

It's best to remove the softened, flaked layer and reapply the polymeric sand, ensuring proper application and watering techniques. 'Do you add water to this': ['yes'], 'Great product. I watered yesterday as directed. I did not water twice. Should I water again today? How long do I need to wait after watering until I can seal the bricks?': ["It's great to hear you're happy with the product! The instructions on the product label state to only water once. Regarding sealing, it's recommended to wait 24 hours after application and watering before sealing your pavers. However, always refer to the sealant manufacturer's instructions for their specific recommended wait times."], 'How many square feet does each pail cover?': ['About 55 square feet depending on the depth and width of seams being filled.', 'About one', '55sf'], 'The tan color description says for joints 1/4" to 1 1/2". But the gray product description says for joints up to only 1/2". Is there a difference because of the color or is this a misprint?': ['The gray (according to the label and instructions) is for joints on pavers that are at least 1.5” deep with seams or gaps between 1/8” and 1/2” wide. So while the pavers must be at least 1.5” thick, any gaps over 1/2” between pavers are too wide.', 'Both colors of Techniseal have the same coverage and usage instructions. The depth must be over 1.5”, but width must be 1/8” to 1/2” only for this brand in either color.']}' metadata={'source': 'Question_Answer'}
